This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Running Playwright end-to-end tests

More info about Playwright here: https://playwright.dev/

All the tests are located in the `/tests` folder. This is also where the report from the tests will be generated. See the `playwright.config.ts` for changing these paths.

The test will automatically start the local production server (`yarn start`) so you'll need to run a production build before running the tests (`yarn build`).

To run the tests use `yarn test:pw` or use the VSCode plugin.
