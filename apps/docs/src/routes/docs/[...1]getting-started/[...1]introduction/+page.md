## Introduction

This monorepo (using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/)) is meant as a template for creating new projects when working with Sanity, Next.js (or SvelteKit) and React/Svelte components and more. The repo is also intended as a "guide" for how to structure your apps and packages.

:::admonition type="info"
All the apps, packages and documentation assumes that you have at least some knowledge of how to work with both Sanity, React, SvelteKit or Next projects. This is not a "getting started" ...thing ðŸ¤“

## What's inside?

This [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

-   `/apps/docs`: This is the documentation you are reading now.
-   `/apps/next-website`: A Next.js website using the pages router
-   `/apps/next-website-app-dir`: A Next.js site using the app router
-   `/apps/next-website-app-dir-intl`: A Next.js site using the app router with localization support
-   `/apps/sanity-studio`: Sanity Studio
-   `/apps/sanity-studio-intl`: Sanity Studio with localization support
-   `/apps/storybook`: A Storybook setup for testing ui components
-   `/apps/web-sveltekit`: A SvelteKit website
-   `/apps/web-sveltekit-intl`: A SvelteKit website with localization support
-   `/packages/common`: Utils that are used in multiple apps
-   `/packages/ui`: React UI components

### Global commands

These are command you can run at the root of the monorepo in order to test multiple apps and packages in one operation. This is typically used for linting all projects and stuff like that. It's not necessary to build all projects from root. It will only affect apps and packages that have the commands defined.

:::admonition type="note"
You need to be at the root of the project for this to work.
:::

-   Build all apps and packages - `yarn build`
-   Lint all apps and packages - `yarn lint`
-   Check formatting for all apps and packages - `yarn prettier:check`

## Working with the apps and packages

**It's recommended to open the apps and packages in separate editor windows**. For example if you are going to work on the next site found in `/apps/next-website`, you should open this folder in a separate editor window. This will make debugging possible and it's probably easier to keep track of files.
