## UI

This package contains React UI components. These are used both in Storybook and by the Next projects.

The idea here is to have React UI components separate from the projects. This way the components can be used by multiple projects. The components can also be independently developed using only Storybook as a tool and then later adopted by the Next projects.

> PS: Right now the content here is a bit ...thin..., this might change.

## How to use the components

Just import it from the ui package like so:

```typescript
import { Alert } from "ui";
```
