This is a SvelteKit project with Sanity integration and some pages

## Getting started

> You need to know how SvelteKit works to use this project, see: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction

To run the project locally, first create a file called `.env`. You can copy the env vars from `.env.example`. All the values for the Sanity variables you'll find when setting up your Sanity project (see the Sanity project readme). The `SANITY_PREVIEW_SECRET` can be any string as long it is the same one as the `SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_TOKEN` you created in the Sanity `.env.development` file.

## Debugging

If you are using Visual Studio Code, there are 3 launch scripts provided. Use them from the debugger menu.

> The Edge debugger requires the Edge Tools for VSCode (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-edgedevtools.vscode-edge-devtools)

-   `Launch server` - Runs the Vite dev server and hooks up the VSCode debugger
-   `Launch Edge` - Opens the site site in the Edge browser and hooks up the VSCode debugger
-   `Server and Browser` - Runs the Vite dev server and opens the site in the Edge browser

## Important files and folders

-   `.svelte-kit` - This is a generated folder with generated types, configs and so on, don't edit it.
-   `/static` - This is for static files such as icons, images and so on
-   `/src` - All of the source code (this is where you edit stuff)
    -   `lib` - This is where you put all the local code that isn't a route
    -   `routes` - The routes/pages and any api endpoints
    -   `app.html` - The base file for the app
    -   `app.css` - The base CSS file.
    -   `app.d.ts` - Definition type file for the root app, see https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/types#app
-   `svelte.config.js` - This is your main config file, see the file itself for comments

## How does Sanity preview work in a SvelteKit app

This SvelteKit app does not pre-generate static files. Every request will request data from the server. This means that we can handle the preview entirely on the server side.

There are 3 important parts to handling previews from Sanity.

### The /api/preview endpoint

This is where all requests from Sanity is directed. This endpoint will do all the work with authenticating the request and generating the correct page to use for the preview.

If a preview can be generated successfully, the endpoint sets a secure cookie to indicate that preview is active.

### The «src/hooks.server.ts» hook/middleware (preview and localization)

This handler is run for all requests. If a preview cookie is found, the hook will set the «locals.preview» param to true. This can then be read as a param by any server route, for any page. The handler also handles localization of routes. It will for example rewrite «/articles» to «[lang]/articles», where «lang» is the current language.

### The data fetching method in common

All the data fetching methods (where preview can be enabled) in common takes a preview param. If preview is true, the method will return drafts as well as published documents. You can then use the «filterDataToSingleItem» to get either a draft or a published document based on the value of the preview param
