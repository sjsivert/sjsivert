## Quickstart

-   clone the repo
-   delete the `.git` folder at the root of the project
-   delete any apps or packages you don't need
-   configure your own Sanity instance and add env variables ([more info](/docs/apps/sanity-studio))
-   run `yarn install`
    -   _I know, you don't actually need the `install` keyword...it just makes it less confusing to type it out_

:::admonition type="tip"
When working with a project is is highly recommended that you edit apps and packages in separate VSCode windows. For example if you are working with the one of the Next apps and Sanity Studio, open those two folders in separate VSCode windows. This will make debugging work, the inline terminal will get all the paths, and the .env files will be read correctly.
