## About this documentation project

This documentation site contains all documentation for the NoA Ignite Template repo for Sanity Studio, Next, Storybook, SvelteKit, and more...

The purpose is twofold:

1. Provide documentation for the packages, apps, and the [template repo itself](https://github.com/makingwaves/sanity-next-component-template-repo).
2. Provide a demo setup for a documentation project.

:::admonition type="info"
This documentation is build using [KitDocs](https://kit-docs.svelteness.dev), which is a theme and a setup on top of SvelteKit.
